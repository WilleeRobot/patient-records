# Patient Records

This Sinatra web application is a prototype for a patient database management system.  The application is meant to be used in a medical clinic setting with multiple physicians working in the clinic, and a centralized administrative system.

Users (i.e. physicians) will create their own unique login with a username and a password.  After creating a login, the user will be able to add patients to his or her profile.  In its current form, the application only allows for primitive patient information as follows: 
    1) Name
    2) Birth Year
    3) Phone
    4) Address
    5) Health Care Number
    
Users will be able to create patient histories for any particular patient.  The history record belongs to the patient who in turn belongs to a specific user, and it is only the specific user that will be able to login, access, read, update, and delete the patient corresponding histories. 

In addition, the main patient list page will show a list of active users in the clinic and number of patients that any particular user has.  This is a blueprint with future extendability to account for the maximum capacity of the clinic and for the individual user.  Further, the user will in the future be able to have specific attributes that define the physician, e.g. specialty, subspecialty, gender, years in practice, etc.

** The code is a work in progress.  Suggestions on how to improve user functionality is welcome. **
